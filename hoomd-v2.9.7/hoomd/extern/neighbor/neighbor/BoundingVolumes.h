 * A bounding box is defined by a lower and upper bound that should fully
 * enclose objects inside it. Internally, the bounds are stored using
 * single-precision floating-point values. If the bounds are given in double precision,
 * they are appropriately rounded down or up, respectively, to fully enclose the
 * given bounds.
 *
 * The BoundingBox also serves as an example of a general bounding volume. Every bounding
 * volume must implement constructors for both single and double precision specifiers.
 * They must also implement an overlap method with as many other bounding volumes as is
 * practical or required. At minimum, they must implement an overlap method with a
 * BoundingBox.
