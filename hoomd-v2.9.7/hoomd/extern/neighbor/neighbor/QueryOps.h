//! Reference implementation of a query operation based on spherical volumes.
/*!
 * A query operation defines a procedure for traversing an LBVH. It must include a few key methods:
 *  1. setup(): Initializes thread-local data for the query.
 *  2. get(): Constructs the bounding volume for a given image.
 *  3. overlap(): Tests if the bounding volume overlaps a bounding box.
 *  4. refine(): Takes a primitive that is overlapped by the bounding volume, and refines the intersection.
 *  5. size(): Return the number of query volumes to test.
 *
 * Each query operation additionally should specify (by typedef, etc.) a \a ThreadData type for its internal
 * data and a \a Volume for the type of query volume used. It is helpful to use a built-in BoundingVolume, which
 * already have overlap tests defined.
 *
 * For accuracy, this reference implementation takes a point defining a spherical volume with radius stored
 * internally as (x,y,z,R). The precision is Scalar, and for accuracy, translations are also performed in Scalar
 * precision. The bounding volume is dropped into appropriate (lower) precision by the BoundingSphere.

     * distance of each other.
     *
     * This method may be called deep within the traversal kernel, so avoid doing too
     * many calculations, loads, etc. if possible.
