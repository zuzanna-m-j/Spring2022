 * Operation to count the number of neighbors during a traversal.
 * This operation is used as a template for neighbor::gpu::lbvh_traverse_ropes.
 *
 * This operation can serve as an example for how to write your own custom
 * traversal operations. Each operation must supply the following:
 *
 *  - ThreadData: a lightweight structure for thread-local data during traversal.
 *  - setup(): a method called at the beginning of the traversal kernel.
 *  - process(): a method to process an intersected primitive.
 *  - finalize(): a method called at the end of the traversal kernel.
 *
 * See each method below for additional details of the type of functionality typically used.
